```env
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=vehicle_rental

```

## üîê Security Best Practices

# Set proper file permissions
chmod -R 755 /path/to/project
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
chmod 600 .env
```

### 3. Database Security
